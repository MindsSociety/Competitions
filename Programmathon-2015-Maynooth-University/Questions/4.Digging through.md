## Problem Statement

You are tasked with finding the cheapest way to dig through the underground
dirt. Each "unit" of dirt is made of different material, each with it's own
cost of digging through. You start from the left and must work your way to the
right. You are constrained in how exactly you can dig. Digging can only be made
forward, upward (lol), and downward.

Given an **N** by **N** grid of integers representing the cost of digging through a
block of dirt find the minimum cost path from left to right.

You may start on any row on the left and finish on any other row on the right.

## Input Format

A single integer **N** : `1 <= N <= 1000`

Followed by **N** lines for the 1 to N costs of digging through the dirt for a
specific row. The costs are space separated.

Each cost **C** is bounded `0 <= C <= 1,000,000`

## Output Format

Output should contain only one integer, minimum cost for digging through the dirt.

## Sample Input
```
5
1 1 9 1 1
3 1 9 7 1
4 1 9 1 1
5 1 1 1 5
6 1 9 3 1
```

## Sample Output
```
9
```

## Explanation

The digging starts are (1, 1) - the top left, moves right once and down 3
times. After, it moves right twice, up once and right once again. Following
that path we have `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9`
