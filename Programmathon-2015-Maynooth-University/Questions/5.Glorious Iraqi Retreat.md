Difficulty: **Hard**
Success Rate: **33.33%**

## Problem Statement

When the Iraqi army was retreating during the Iranian counter offensive the
soldiers were ordered to take whatever they could from their tanks and armoured
stores. The retreating brigade can only carry so much and Saddam wants them to
bring back the most value as possible. Your goal, being a supporter of Iran is
to calculate the loss the Iraqis will suffer financially in their retreat.

## Input Format

The first line contains two integers **C** and **N**, representing the capacity
the brigade can hold and the number of supply items you can choose from.

`1 <= C <= 8,000 and 1 <= N <= 10,000`

Following the first line will be **N** lines of two space seperated integers
`V` and `W` representing the value and weight of the item.

## Output Format

A single integer representing the financial cost of the retreat.

## Sample Input
```
5 4
3 2
7 3
2 4
9 5
```

## Sample Output
```
11
```

## Explanation

The maximum value the army can take in it's retreat is 10 and the total value
is 21, therefore a lose of 11 is incurred.
