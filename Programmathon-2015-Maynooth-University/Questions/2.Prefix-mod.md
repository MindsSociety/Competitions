## Problem Statement

Prefix/Polish notation is a method of writing mathematical expressions where
brackets are not required for grouping expressions. Operators (functions) are
put before the operands. If the operand is a function it must be recursively.
One problem with generating test cases for these kinds of questions is exceeding
the integer size in certain languages. To compensate for this each prefix
expression you have to evaluate is given a mod value, where each number and
expression must be "modded" by this value at each step.

Please note that modding a negative number will produce a positive number. Be
wary that some languages don't support this so you'll have to do it manually.
Example : `-1 % 5 -> 4`

## Input Format

A number N indicating how many expressions you will be required to evaluate.
Followed by N lines of prefix expressions. Each expression is space seperated,
with the mod M being the first part of the expression (see below if this is
confusing)

`1 <= N <= 2,000`

`1 < M <= 1,000`

The operators being used are plus, minus, and multiply.

## Output Format

N lines with each lines contraining a single number representing the value of
the expression evaluated.

## Sample Input
```
2
6 + 1 - 10 1
2 - 8 6
```

## Sample Output
```
4
0
```

## Explanation

6 + 1 - 10 1 -> (1 % 6 + (10 % 6- 1 % 6) % 6) % 6 = 4

2 - 8 6 -> (8 % 2 - 6 % 2) % 2 = 0
